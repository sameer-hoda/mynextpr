# Comprehensive End-to-End Changes Document

This document summarizes the entire process of converting the `mynextpr` web application into a native mobile app, setting up a cloud-based build system, and deploying all necessary backend changes to the live EC2 server. It covers the challenges encountered, the solutions implemented, and the final state of the project.

---

### **Phase 1: Initial Goal & Local Mobile Build**

The primary objective was to take the existing React web application and package it as native Android and iOS apps using Capacitor, while ensuring the live web application at `mynextpr.com` remained functional.

**Challenges Encountered:**
*   **Android Emulator Instability:** Initial attempts to run the app on a local Android emulator were met with `Broken pipe` and `System UI not responding` errors.
    *   **Solution:** Diagnosed that the issue was caused by an unstable Android 15 Developer Preview (API 35). The problem was resolved by creating a new emulator with a stable public version of Android (API 34).
*   **Local Development Complexity:** The user found the process of managing local Android Studio and Xcode installations to be too cumbersome.
    *   **Solution:** We pivoted to using **Ionic Appflow**, a cloud-based CI/CD service, to handle the native app builds. This eliminated the need for a local native development environment.

### **Phase 2: Cloud Build Setup & Troubleshooting (Ionic Appflow)**

To enable cloud builds, the project was pushed to a GitHub repository and connected to Ionic Appflow. This phase involved an iterative debugging process to get the first successful build.

**Challenges Encountered:**
1.  **Git Initialization Failure:** The initial `git commit` failed because files were not staged.
    *   **Solution:** Corrected the Git command sequence by running `git add .` before `git commit`.
2.  **GitHub Push Protection:** The push was blocked because sensitive `.env` files containing secrets were included in the commit.
    *   **Solution:** Created a `.gitignore` file to exclude all `.env` files and `node_modules`. The sensitive files were then removed from the Git history using `git rm --cached` and the commit was amended.
3.  **Build Failure 1: Submodule Errors:** The build failed because the `plan-my-run` and a backup folder contained their own `.git` repositories, which Git treated as invalid submodules.
    *   **Solution:** Systematically removed the nested `.git` directories and the submodule links from the main repository's tracking, then re-added the folders so their contents were tracked directly.
4.  **Build Failure 2: `package.json` Not Found:** Appflow could not find the project's `package.json` because it was in the `plan-my-run` subdirectory, not the repository root.
    *   **Solution:** Created an `appflow.config.json` file in the root directory to specify the `root` of the mobile app project.
5.  **Build Failure 3: Missing `appId`:** The build failed because the `appflow.config.json` was missing the unique App ID from the Ionic dashboard.
    *   **Solution:** Added the correct `appId` to the `appflow.config.json` file.
6.  **Build Failure 4: Android Platform Not Added:** The `npx cap sync` command failed because the native `android` project directory did not exist in the repository.
    *   **Solution:** The `android` directory, which was previously ignored, was forcibly added to the Git repository using `git add -f`.

**Outcome:** After these fixes, the Ionic Appflow build succeeded, producing a downloadable `.apk` file.

### **Phase 3: Runtime Debugging & Core Functionality Fixes**

The successfully built app had several runtime issues that needed to be addressed.

**Challenges Encountered:**
1.  **White Screen on Launch:** The app installed but showed a blank white screen.
    *   **Solution:** Using Chrome Remote Debugging, we identified a `ReferenceError: useNavigate is not defined` in `App.tsx`. This was fixed by restructuring the component to ensure the `useNavigate` hook was called correctly within the context of the `BrowserRouter`.
2.  **Login Redirected to `localhost`:** The Google Login button redirected to the wrong backend URL.
    *   **Solution:** Audited the frontend code and found that both `AuthContext.tsx` and `apiClient.ts` were using an incorrect environment variable (`VITE_BACKEND_URL`). This was corrected to use `VITE_API_URL`, which was configured in the Appflow build environment.
3.  **Login Flow Stuck in Browser:** After a successful Google login, the user was redirected to the website in the browser instead of returning to the mobile app.
    *   **Solution:** A robust, platform-aware authentication flow was implemented:
        *   The frontend now detects if it's a mobile or web platform and sends an `origin` parameter to the backend.
        *   The backend was updated to use this `origin` parameter to intelligently redirect users to either the website (`https://mynextpr.com/...`) or a custom app URL scheme (`com.runna.app://...`).
        *   The Android app was configured to respond to this custom URL scheme, and the frontend was updated to handle the deep link, bringing the user back into the app seamlessly.

### **Phase 4: Live Deployment to EC2 & Server-Side Fixes**

The final step was to deploy all the backend and frontend fixes to the live server at `mynextpr.com`.

**Challenges Encountered:**
1.  **"Test User" Button in Production:** The user requested the removal of the "Continue as Test User" button before the final deployment.
    *   **Solution:** The button and its corresponding logic were removed from `Index.tsx` and `AuthContext.tsx`.
2.  **Deployment Caused Site Outage:** An initial, incorrect deployment caused the live website to fail with the `useNavigate` error.
    *   **Solution:** A full rollback was performed on the EC2 server by restoring the code from a timestamped backup that was created before the deployment began.
3.  **Server Build Failure (`sharp`/`libvips`):** The deployment script failed during `npm install` on the EC2 server because the `sharp` library could not be compiled.
    *   **Solution:** After confirming that the required `libvips` library was not available in the server's repositories, the root cause was traced to the `@capacitor/assets` dev dependency. This package was removed from `package.json`, and a clean `package-lock.json` was generated and committed to the repository to permanently remove `sharp` from the dependency tree.
4.  **Server Runtime Failure (`JWT_SECRET`):** After a successful deployment, the login flow failed because the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable was not available to the application.
    *   **Solution:** The `.env` file, which was correctly excluded from the repository, was created directly on the server with the correct production values. The PM2 process was then deleted and restarted to ensure it loaded the new environment variables.
5.  **Final Redirect Polish:** The post-login redirect was still not seamless, leaving the user on a blank "Loading..." page.
    *   **Solution:** The logic in `AuthCallback.tsx` was simplified to only save the token and redirect to the root (`/`). This allows the main `Index.tsx` component to handle all post-login routing, creating a single, reliable flow. This final fix was then deployed to the server.

### **Final Outcome**

*   The `mynextpr.com` website is fully functional, with a robust authentication system that supports both web and mobile clients.
*   The project is configured for cloud-based native builds via Ionic Appflow, removing the need for local native SDKs.
*   The mobile app login flow is seamless, correctly redirecting from the external browser back into the application.
*   All debugging artifacts and temporary fixes (like the "Test User" button) have been removed from the production codebase.
