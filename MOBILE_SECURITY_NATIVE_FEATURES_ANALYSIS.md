# Mobile App Security and Native Features Analysis

## Security Considerations

### Current State
- JWT tokens are stored in Capacitor Preferences and localStorage
- No automatic token refresh mechanism
- No secure storage beyond basic device storage
- No app-level security features implemented

### Security Gaps
1. **Token Storage Security**:
   - Current storage method is vulnerable to device compromise
   - No encryption of JWT tokens on device storage
   - No protection against memory dumps

2. **Session Management**:
   - No automatic token refresh mechanism
   - No session expiry handling
   - No logout on app deinstallation

3. **Secure Communication**:
   - No certificate pinning
   - No additional transport security beyond HTTPS
   - No network traffic validation

4. **Device Security**:
   - No jailbreak/ root detection
   - No app tampering protection
   - No biometric authentication for sensitive operations

### Recommended Security Enhancements
1. **Enhanced Token Storage**:
   - Implement secure keychain storage for iOS
   - Use encrypted shared preferences for Android
   - Consider using Capacitor community plugins for secure storage

2. **Token Refresh System**:
   - Implement automatic token refresh using refresh tokens
   - Add silent refresh when app comes to foreground
   - Handle token expiry gracefully

3. **App Security Features**:
   - Add jailbreak/ root detection
   - Implement app integrity checks
   - Consider biometric authentication for sensitive operations

## Native Features Missing

### Current Native Features Implemented
- JWT-based authentication
- Capacitor preferences for storage
- Basic routing from OAuth callback

### Missing Native Features
1. **User Experience Enhancements**:
   - Haptic feedback for interactions
   - Local notifications for reminders
   - App badge updates
   - Background task management

2. **Device Integration**:
   - App lifecycle management (pause, resume)
   - Device information access
   - Network status monitoring
   - Biometric authentication
   - Camera access for profile photos
   - Health data integration

3. **UI/UX Optimizations**:
   - Safe area handling for notch devices
   - Android back button handling
   - Native navigation patterns
   - Offline mode with cached data
   - App-specific loading states

4. **Performance Features**:
   - Background sync for data updates
   - Local data caching
   - Optimized image loading
   - Battery-conscious operations

## Mobile-Specific Considerations

### Platform Differences
1. **iOS vs Android**:
   - Different permission models
   - Different notification handling
   - Different security approaches
   - Different UI patterns

2. **Network Conditions**:
   - Variable network speeds
   - Potential for intermittent connectivity
   - Data usage considerations
   - Offline capabilities

### User Experience Factors
1. **Mobile-First Design**:
   - Touch-optimized interfaces
   - Thumb-friendly navigation
   - Reduced cognitive load
   - Quick task completion

2. **Battery and Performance**:
   - Efficient background processing
   - Minimal resource usage
   - Cached data strategies
   - Smart sync mechanisms
