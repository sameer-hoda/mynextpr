  "plan_overview": "This 3-week 10K training plan for an intermediate 35-year-old runner targeting 55:30 is built upon the principles of Jack Daniels' VDOT formula. With a target 10K time of 55:30, your estimated VDOT is approximately 35. This plan incorporates Daniels' key training intensities: Easy (E), Tempo (T), and Interval (I) paces, along with Repetition (R) pace for strides.\n\nThe plan is designed to be progressive, introducing you to different physiological stimuli each week:\n*   **Week 1** focuses on establishing your base and introducing you to the core Daniels paces through a mix of easy, tempo, interval, and long runs.\n*   **Week 2** builds on these foundations, introducing cruise intervals for sustained speed and incorporating a dedicated strength session to enhance resilience and power.\n*   **Week 3** hones your race-specific fitness with a 10K goal pace simulation workout and includes cross-training for low-impact aerobic development, culminating in a final easy run.\n\nEach workout specifies detailed warm-up, main set, and cool-down routines, along with estimated duration and distance. Remember to listen to your body, adjust paces as needed based on how you feel, and prioritize recovery and nutrition. This plan is a solid introduction to structured training and will help you build fitness towards your 55:30 10K goal.",
