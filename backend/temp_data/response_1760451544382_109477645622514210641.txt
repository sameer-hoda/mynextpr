  "plan_overview": "This 12-day training plan, rooted in the Daniels' running philosophy, focuses on developing all key physiological systems for your 10K goal. It strategically incorporates easy runs for aerobic base, tempo runs for lactate threshold improvement, and VO2 max intervals for speed and efficiency, balanced with crucial rest days for optimal recovery and adaptation.",
