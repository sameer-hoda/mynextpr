  "plan_overview": "This two-week plan focuses on building marathon-specific endurance and speed using Daniels' principles. It incorporates a mix of aerobic development, tempo work, and speed intervals, with adequate recovery to ensure adaptation and prevent overtraining. The long runs are crucial for simulating race-day demands.",
