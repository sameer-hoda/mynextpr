You are a professional running coach. Create a personalized 10K training plan for a Intermediate runner who is 35 years old and identifies as unspecified.
The user is looking for a plan guided by a daniels approach.
The goal time is 55:30.

The plan should include 12 varied workouts over the course of the training period. Each workout should include the following fields:
- day: (numeric day in the training sequence)
- title: (descriptive title of the workout)
- type: (one of: easy_run, intervals, tempo_run, long_run, strength, cross_train, rest)
- description: (detailed description of the workout)
- warmup: (specific warmup routine)
- main_set: (detailed main workout set)
- cooldown: (specific cooldown routine)
- duration_minutes: (estimated duration in minutes)
- distance_km: (estimated distance in kilometers)

Return the plan as a JSON array of workout objects, each with the fields mentioned. Include an overall plan overview as well. Format the response as a JSON object with two properties:
1. "plan_overview": A brief description of the overall approach and philosophy
2. "workouts": An array of workout objects with the specified fields

Ensure that the JSON is properly formatted and can be parsed by JSON.parse().
Make sure each workout has all required fields and that the content is appropriate for the runner's fitness level.
For rest days, set type to "rest", and set duration_minutes and distance_km to null.
For each workout, be specific about paces (e.g., "easy conversational pace", "at 10K race pace", etc.) and distances for different segments.
