  "plan_overview": "This 10K training plan is designed for an intermediate 35-year-old runner targeting a goal time of 55:30, utilizing the principles of Jack Daniels' VDOT approach. The plan spans approximately 8 weeks, with 12 key workouts structured to progressively build aerobic fitness, speed endurance, lactate threshold, and race-specific pacing. Paces are calculated based on a VDOT of 38 (derived from a 55:30 10K), providing specific guidance for Easy (E), Threshold (T), Interval (I), and Repetition (R) efforts, as well as the target 10K Race Pace (RP). The plan incorporates a mix of long runs, tempo runs, interval training, and active recovery to ensure a well-rounded and effective preparation for race day. Recovery and listening to your body are paramount for success and injury prevention. This plan focuses on the key, structured workouts; remember to incorporate additional easy runs and adequate rest days between these sessions.",
