  "plan_overview": "This 3-week 10K training plan is designed for an intermediate 35-year-old runner targeting a 1:00:10 finish time, based on Jack Daniels' Running Formula. The plan utilizes Daniels' VDOT concept, which for a 10K time of 1:00:10, corresponds to an approximate VDOT of 32.5. This VDOT level dictates specific training paces to optimize physiological adaptations.\n\nKey Paces for VDOT 32.5:\n-   **Easy (E) Pace:** 7:00-7:20 min/km (conversational, low effort)\n-   **Threshold (T) Pace:** 5:50-6:00 min/km (comfortably hard, sustainable for ~60 minutes in a race)\n-   **Interval (I) Pace:** 5:25-5:35 min/km (hard, for shorter intervals with recovery, targeting VO2max)\n-   **Repetition (R) Pace:** 4:50-5:00 min/km (very fast, for short strides, improving speed and economy)\n\nThe plan incorporates a variety of workouts including Easy Runs for aerobic base and recovery, Tempo Runs to improve lactate threshold, Interval Training to boost VDOT and speed endurance, Long Runs for overall endurance, and Strength/Cross-Training for injury prevention and balanced fitness. The structure progresses through building intensity, followed by a taper to ensure you arrive at the starting line fresh and ready for your goal race. Remember to listen to your body, adjust as needed, and prioritize recovery.",
