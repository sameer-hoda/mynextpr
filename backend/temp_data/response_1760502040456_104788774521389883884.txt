  "plan_overview": "This two-week Maffetone-based plan focuses on building your aerobic base and endurance for your marathon goal.  The majority of your running will be at a very low intensity (Zone 2) to maximize fat utilization and minimize injury risk.  We'll incorporate one longer run to simulate race-day demands and a tempo session to improve lactate threshold.  Remember to listen to your body and adjust as needed.",
