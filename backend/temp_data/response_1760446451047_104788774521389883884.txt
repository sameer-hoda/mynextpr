  "plan_overview": "This 12-week Half Marathon training plan is designed for an intermediate 35-year-old runner aiming for a 2:09:30 finish time, guided by the principles of Jack Daniels' Running Formula. The plan focuses on developing all physiological systems crucial for endurance running, using specific training intensities (Easy, Marathon, Threshold, Interval, Repetition paces) derived from your target VDOT (approximately 35). This JSON response provides 12 representative and varied workouts that illustrate the progression and types of sessions you would undertake over the 12-week period, rather than every single workout for all 12 weeks. The full plan would typically include 4-5 running days, 1-2 cross-training/strength days, and 1-2 rest days per week, with gradual increases in volume and intensity, culminating in a taper before race day. These 12 workouts are key examples of the types of training you'll encounter at different stages.",
