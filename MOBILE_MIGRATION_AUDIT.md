# Mobile Migration Audit - Runna Application

## Current State Analysis

### Backend Authentication System
✓ **JWT Implementation**: The backend already has JWT authentication implemented with `jsonwebtoken` library
✓ **Protected Routes**: Most API routes are protected with the `protectWithJwt` middleware
✓ **Google OAuth Integration**: Google OAuth callback properly generates and returns JWT tokens
✓ **Rate Limiting**: Proper rate limiting in place for API endpoints

### Frontend Authentication System
✓ **JWT Storage**: Tokens are stored in both Capacitor Preferences and localStorage with Capacitor fallback
✓ **API Client Integration**: All API calls include Authorization header with JWT tokens
✓ **Auth Callback**: Proper handling of Google OAuth callback with token storage
✓ **Auth Context**: Comprehensive authentication context for managing user state

### Capacitor Integration Status
✓ **Basic Setup**: Capacitor is configured with iOS and Android platforms
✓ **Preferences Plugin**: @capacitor/preferences plugin is installed and implemented
✓ **JWT Flow**: Successful JWT authentication flow from Google OAuth to mobile storage

### Missing Components Identified

#### Native Features
- [ ] **Haptics**: @capacitor/haptics plugin now installed but not implemented
- [ ] **Local Notifications**: @capacitor/local-notifications plugin now installed but not implemented
- [ ] **App Lifecycle Management**: @capacitor/app plugin now installed but not implemented
- [ ] **Device Information**: @capacitor/device plugin now installed but not used
- [ ] **Network Status**: @capacitor/network plugin now installed but not used

#### UI/UX Considerations
- [ ] **Safe Areas**: No implementation of safe area handling for modern mobile devices
- [ ] **Back Button Handling**: No custom back button handling for Android
- [ ] **Offline Support**: No offline data caching strategy
- [ ] **App Icons & Splash Screen**: No custom icons/splash implemented

#### Security Considerations
- [ ] **Token Refresh Mechanism**: No automatic token refresh implemented
- [ ] **Secure Storage**: Tokens stored in preferences without additional encryption
- [ ] **Session Management**: No automatic session expiry handling
- [ ] **Biometric Authentication**: No optional biometric authentication

#### Performance & Production Readiness
- [ ] **API Base URLs**: VITE_BACKEND_URL still uses localhost in .env.local
- [ ] **Build Configuration**: No production build profiles
- [ ] **Push Notifications**: Local notifications only, no push notification service
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Limited mobile-specific error handling
