# Mobile App Security and Native Features Analysis

## Critical Security Issues That Must Be Addressed

### CRITICAL BACKEND SECURITY ISSUE: Hardcoded OAuth Callback URL
**Issue**: The Google OAuth callback URL in `backend/server.js` is hardcoded to production values, which will break development and staging environments and represents a security risk.

**Risk Level**: CRITICAL
**Impact**: Will break authentication flow in non-production environments
**Fix Required**: Update to use environment variables

**Current Code**:
```javascript
callbackURL: "https://mynextpr.com/api/auth/google/callback"
```

**Required Fix**:
```javascript
callbackURL: process.env.GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL || 
           (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
             ? "https://mynextpr.com/api/auth/google/callback" 
             : "http://localhost:3001/auth/google/callback")
```

## Security Considerations

### Current State
- JWT tokens are stored in Capacitor Preferences and localStorage
- No automatic token refresh mechanism
- No secure storage beyond basic device storage
- No app-level security features implemented
- Backend OAuth callback URL hardcoded to production (CRITICAL ISSUE)
- No production security headers (Helmet.js) implemented

### Security Gaps and Vulnerabilities

#### 1. **Token Storage Security**:
   - Current storage method is vulnerable to device compromise
   - No encryption of JWT tokens on device storage
   - No protection against memory dumps
   - Tokens accessible through both Capacitor Preferences and localStorage
   - Risk of token theft on rooted/jailbroken devices

#### 2. **Session Management**:
   - No automatic token refresh mechanism
   - No session expiry handling
   - No logout on app deinstallation
   - No token revocation mechanism
   - No concurrent session management

#### 3. **Secure Communication**:
   - No certificate pinning
   - No additional transport security beyond HTTPS
   - No network traffic validation
   - No API rate limiting for mobile clients

#### 4. **Backend Security**:
   - CRITICAL: OAuth callback URL hardcoded to production (breaks dev/staging)
   - Missing production security headers (Helmet.js)
   - Inadequate CORS configuration for mobile environments
   - No proper environment-specific configurations

#### 5. **Device Security**:
   - No jailbreak/ root detection
   - No app tampering protection
   - No biometric authentication for sensitive operations
   - No app integrity checks

#### 6. **Data Security**:
   - No encryption for sensitive data stored locally
   - No secure data transmission validation
   - No audit logging for sensitive operations
   - No data retention policies

### Recommended Security Enhancements

#### High Priority Security Fixes (Must Be Done First)
1. **Fix OAuth Configuration**: Update callback URLs to use environment variables

   - Implement automatic token refresh using refresh tokens
   - Add silent refresh when app comes to foreground
   - Handle token expiry gracefully
   - Implement proper token lifecycle management

3. **Session Management**:
   - Add automatic logout on token expiry
   - Implement secure logout mechanism
   - Add session timeout functionality
   - Consider token revocation on suspicious activity

#### Phase 2: App Security Features
1. **Device Security**:
   - Add jailbreak/ root detection
   - Implement app integrity checks

   - Add screenshot prevention for sensitive screens

2. **Communication Security**:
   - Implement certificate pinning for critical operations
   - Add request signature verification
   - Implement secure API communication patterns
   - Add request/response encryption for sensitive data

#### Phase 3: Additional Security Measures
1. **Monitoring and Auditing**:
   - Add security event logging
   - Implement anomaly detection
   - Add user activity monitoring
   - Implement security incident response

2. **Privacy and Compliance**:
   - Add GDPR/CCPA compliance features
   - Implement data minimization
   - Add user consent management
   - Ensure compliance with app store policies

## Native Features Missing
