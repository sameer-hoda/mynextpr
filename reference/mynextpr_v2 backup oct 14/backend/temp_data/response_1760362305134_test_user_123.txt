  "plan_overview": "This 10K training plan is designed for an intermediate 35-year-old runner aiming for a goal time of 55:30, utilizing the principles of Jack Daniels' VDOT training. The plan spans approximately 9 weeks, focusing on developing various physiological systems crucial for 10K performance. It incorporates a balanced mix of Easy (E), Threshold (T), Interval (I), and Long (L) runs, along with strength training and cross-training to build endurance, speed, and prevent injury. Paces are calculated based on a VDOT of 36, aligning with the 55:30 10K goal. The plan progressively increases volume and intensity, culminating in a race-specific tune-up before race day. Remember to listen to your body, adjust as needed, and prioritize recovery.",
