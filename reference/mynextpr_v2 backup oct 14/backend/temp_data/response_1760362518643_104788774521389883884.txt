  "plan_overview": "This 10K training plan is designed for an intermediate 35-year-old runner with a goal time of 55:30, following the principles of Daniels' Running Formula. Based on your goal, your VDOT (a measure of running fitness) is estimated at approximately 32-33, which guides the prescribed training paces for optimal development.\n\nThe plan spans approximately 8 weeks, with these 12 structured workouts representing the core of your training. It is crucial to supplement these key sessions with 2-3 easy conversational runs per week (40-60 minutes each) and 1-2 dedicated rest days. Cross-training (e.g., cycling, swimming) can be incorporated on easy days or active recovery days if desired, but is not explicitly included in these 12 workouts beyond one strength session.\n\nThe training schedule is built around Daniels' five intensity zones:\n*   **Easy (E) / Long (L) Pace:** Comfortable, conversational pace for building aerobic base and recovery. (Approx. 6:10-6:40 min/km)\n*   **Threshold (T) Pace:** Sustainably hard pace that improves lactate threshold, crucial for 10K performance. (Approx. 5:15-5:25 min/km)\n*   **Interval (I) Pace:** Vigorously hard pace for improving VO2 max and running economy. (Approx. 4:50-5:00 min/km)\n*   **Repetition (R) Pace:** Very fast, short bursts for improving speed and neuromuscular coordination. (Approx. 4:30-4:40 min/km)\n*   **10K Race Pace:** Your target pace for the 10K race (5:33 min/km).\n\nEach workout is designed to target specific physiological adaptations, progressing in intensity and volume as you get closer to race day. Remember to always listen to your body, adjust paces as needed, and prioritize recovery. Good luck with your training and race!",
